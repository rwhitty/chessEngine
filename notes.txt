Current to-dos:
    - Implement logic for castling
    - Implement logic for check and checkmate
    - Implement pawn promotion
    - Implement logic for en-passant
    - Switch to lighter piece representation - don't need rank/file/value
    - Try to make it so board doesn't get copied every time
    - Update evaluation function to include the following:
        - Pawn structure: Passed, isolated, doubled
        - King safety
        - Piece activity
    - Implement a positions cache (as a hashmap)
    - Implement move ordering
        - Checks, captures, threats, in that order
